	<p>So, here we are, trying out a little HTML5.  Not convinced that it's the silver
	bullet (conditional statements for cross browser love make me want to jam something 
	in someone's eye, perhaps my own, or perhaps that of another).  But, after just a few
	minutes of nerding out, I have to say that it's a good step for web markup in general.</p>

	<p>I would love to see a mortorium on non-XHTML compliant pages.  To heck with supporting
	legacy content.  Damn the backward compatibility.  Clean markup for all!</p>
	
	<p>Anyway...  I think I'll make this text white, and STFU for a while.</p>
